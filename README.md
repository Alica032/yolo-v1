In this project, the full pipeline for [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) obejct detection network is reproduced in Pytorch.

### Goals:

  - Learn specifics and details of object detection pipeline through implementations.
  - Practice incremental development of a DL model and service.
  - Integrate frameworks for training, logging and deploying a DL project.
  - Manage project with GitHub features.
